Should avoid creating generic arrays like ArrayList<T>[], instead do ArrrayList<ArrayList<T>>

If you create an instance variable like ArrayList<> someList, have to initialize it inside the constructor before using it:
		someList = new ArrayList<T>();

Why the hashmap is fast: look at get method - first narrow down search to a specific bucket (keyIndex). 

A class implements an interface. An interface can extend another interface (wouldn't implement). 

If class or a superclass extends Iterable interface, have to override the iterator() method which returns an Iterator object. 
	customize the Itertor object that will be returned by having a nested class that implements Iterator
		write the hasNext and next methods

	ConcurrentModificationException: iterating through a hashset and removing the keys.
		create a copy of the hashset to iterate through.
